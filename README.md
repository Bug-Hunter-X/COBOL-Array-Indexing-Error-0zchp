This repository contains a sample COBOL program demonstrating a common array indexing error. The program attempts to populate a table, but due to an off-by-one error in the indexing, the last element is not properly populated.  The solution demonstrates how to correct this issue.  This is a great example of a subtle bug that can lead to difficult-to-debug problems in COBOL applications.
